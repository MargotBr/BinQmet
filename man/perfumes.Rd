 Perfumes data set
}
\description{
In the 'perfumes' study, a panel of 120 participants was recruited and asked to sort each of 39 perfumes into one of two predefined categories: 'perfumes representative of the concept of innovation' and 'perfumes not representative of the concept of innovation'. The experiment led to 120 profiles of 39-dimensional binary ratings. Additionally, external information about the raters were collected, such as their gender (F or M) and their age bracket (-18, 18-22, +22). Data were also supplemented by twenty-seven covariates providing information about the stimuli (numeric evaluations of the intensity of several sensory characteristics such as 'acid', 'sweet', 'sugar', 'strong').
